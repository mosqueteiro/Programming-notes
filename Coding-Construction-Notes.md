# Coding Construction Notes  
These notes are mostly taken from reading the book [_Code Complete: A practical Handbook of Software Construction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete).

* [Prerequisites](#3-prerequisites)

## 3 Prerequisites
### 3.4 Requirements Prerequisite  
#### Why Have Requirements?  
* helps minimize system changes
* requirements errors are much harder and more expensive to fix than coding errors

#### Myth of Stable Requirements  
* requirements change as needs are discovered
* on average requirements change 25% over the course of a project

#### Handling Requirements Changes During Construction  
* check requirements for validity/quality (use checklist); make sure you're headed in the right direction with the project
* make sure everyone knows the cost of changes
* setup a procedure for changes
* use a interative design approach to allow changes to be incorporated more easily
* consider dumping the project if it gets too out of hand, or know when to quit
* keep an eye on the business case for the project
